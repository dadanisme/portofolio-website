This is an example project demonstrating the MDX content system. It includes headings, code blocks, lists, and more.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, you'll need to have Node.js installed on your machine. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies with `npm install`
3. Run the development server with `npm run dev`

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js 18 or later
- npm or yarn package manager

## Features

This project includes several key features:

- **Type Safety**: Built with TypeScript for robust type checking
- **Modern React**: Uses React 19 with the latest features
- **Server Components**: Leverages Next.js App Router for optimal performance

### Code Example

Here's a simple example of a React component:

```tsx
export function Button({ children }: { children: React.ReactNode }) {
  return (
    <button className="px-4 py-2 bg-primary text-primary-foreground">
      {children}
    </button>
  );
}
```

## Architecture

The project follows a clean architecture pattern with clear separation of concerns.

### Component Structure

Components are organized into three categories:

- `ui/` - Base UI components (buttons, inputs, etc.)
- `shared/` - Reusable composite components
- `sections/` - Page-level section components

## Conclusion

This example project demonstrates the capabilities of the MDX content system. Feel free to use it as a starting point for your own projects.
